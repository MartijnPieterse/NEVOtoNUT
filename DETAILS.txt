This file contains information about how each field was calculated.

The conversion is mainly about finding the correct values in the NEVO 
database (NEVO-Online versie 2001_3.0) and setting them in the right field.

NUT uses the same fields as the usda database, which can be found at 
http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR25/asc/NUTR_DEF.txt
(Some fields did not have a field name, i used XXXX in that case to keep it 
 readable)

The same information can be found in nut.txt and nutlight.txt, but these
are a bit more cryptic.

nut.txt is meant to be the complete converstion.
nutlight.txt is meant to be for P/C/F only. (It was a quick-hack to get started.)

CHOCDF - Carbohydrate, by difference
   This is the sum of:

   Note: This is partly wrong. Some water-soluable fiber can be
         converted to fatty acids by gut bacteria. But this information
         is not available in the dutch database.

   This is the sum of:

   3.33 * 11001 - Retinol
   1.66 * 11003 - Beta-caroteen
   0.83 * 11020 - Alpha-catoteen
   0.83 * 11023 - Beta-cryptoxanthin

   This was verified against (Carrots, Raw) from the USDA database.

   Note: Copied from wikipedia:
         As some carotenoids can be converted into vitamin A, attempts have been
         made to determine how much of them in the diet is equivalent to a 
         particular amount of retinol, so that comparisons can be made of the
         benefit of different foods. The situation can be confusing because the
         accepted equivalences have changed. For many years, a system of 
         equivalencies in which an international unit (IU) was equal to 0.3 ug 
         of retinol, 0.6 ug of beta-carotene, or 1.2 ug of other provitamin-A 
         carotenoids was used.[14] Later, a unit called retinol equivalent (RE) 
         was introduced. Prior to 2001, one RE corresponded to 1 ug retinol, 
         2 ug beta-carotene dissolved in oil (it is only partly dissolved in most
         supplement pills, due to very poor solubility in any medium), 6 ug 
         beta-carotene in normal food (because it is not absorbed as well as when
         in oils), and 12 ug of either alpha-carotene, gamma-carotene, or 
         beta-cryptoxanthin in food.

         Newer research has shown that the absorption of provitamin-A 
         carotenoids is only half as much as previously thought. As a result, 
         in 2001 the US Institute of Medicine recommended a new unit, the 
         retinol activity equivalent (RAE). Each ug RAE corresponds to 1 ug 
         retinol, 2 ug of beta-carotene in oil, 12 ug of "dietary" beta-carotene,
         or 24 ug of the three other dietary provitamin-A carotenoids.[15]

   Note(2):
         The dutch database also contains 11002 - Retinol equivalents. This
         is based on: (in the database of 2001)
            1 RE =  1 µg retinol
                 =  6 µg beta-caroteen
                 = 12 µg andere provitamine A carotenoïden
         source: http://www.voorlichtingmvo.nl/gfx/file/vitamine060.pdf

         In the report it is mentioned a new calculation of RE is needed,
         but a check on a couple of products did not indicate that
         this formule has been changed for the current database.
